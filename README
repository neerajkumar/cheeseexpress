http://demoapp.heroku.com is an application developed by me for an Indian Client to demonstrate the cheese of his shop. 
This is a very basic ruby on rails application with a little bit modifications. It also comprises the beautiful UIs. 

Steps to run the application:

1. configure the config/database.yml.
2. run the command rake gems:install ==> it mainly ask for mislav_will-paginate and RedCloth gems. Therefore install these two gems first.
3. run the command rake db:create
4. run the command rake db:migrate
5. Now start your ror app server to run the application.

The application is also having the use of various plugins as textile_editor_helper, paperclip, defunkt-acts_as_textiled etc.



# whenever you get the error: failed to build gem native extension >>> 'nmake' etc use

sudo gem install RedCloth --platform=mswin32
